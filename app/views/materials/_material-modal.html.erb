          <p>Paper recycling is the circular process of turning old waste paper into new paper,
          this recycling and producing process is called papermaking. Paper is a 100% natural and
          recyclable resource made of wood fibers. Therefore paper waste is the most important ingredient
          for the process of creating new paper and cardboard products.</p>

          <p>Plastic is a popular and highly versatile material, and we use a lot of it.
          Re-using and recycling items as many times as possible can reduce our need to create new plastic.
          Any plastic material with food residues on (or in) it cannot be recycled.
          So, remember to always clean your recyclable products!</p>
